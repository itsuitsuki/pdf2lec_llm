**Slide 1 Introduction:**  
"Did you know that making a decision based on data alone can often lead to wrong conclusions if we ignore the underlying hypotheses? Today's lecture will explore the crucial role of likelihood ratios in binary hypothesis testing and introduce the Bayesian approach to decision-making, emphasizing how these concepts enhance our ability to interpret data amid uncertainty."

**Slide 2 Introduction:**  
"Have you ever faced a decision where choosing incorrectly could have significant consequences? In today's lecture, we'll delve into the framework of optimal decision-making under uncertainty, focusing on cost minimization and the Neyman-Pearson approach, which offers systematic strategies to balance errors in hypothesis testing."

**Slide 3 Introduction:**  
"Imagine being able to reduce the chances of making a wrong decision simply by applying a mathematical rule. Today, we will discuss optimal decision rules using likelihood ratios, highlighting how to minimize detection errors through robust statistical methods, especially in the context of signals hidden within noise."

**Slide 4 Introduction:**  
"Did you know that the choice of a statistical distribution can dramatically influence the outcomes of hypothesis testing? In this lecture, we'll examine the application of likelihood ratios within normal and Poisson distributions, demonstrating how these analytical tools help define decision thresholds and improve accuracy even in the face of uncertainty."
