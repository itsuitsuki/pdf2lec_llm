Let's focus on the optimal decision rule outlined in the context of hypothesis testing. We explored earlier how decisions are made based on the likelihood ratio. Here, we're diving into a more nuanced approach to decision rules that balance the trade-offs between false alarms and missed detections under certain constraints.

First, we have the optimal decision rule itself. We decide on the null hypothesis, H-naught, if our likelihood ratio, L of X, is less than a certain threshold, denoted by Lambda. Conversely, we lean towards the alternate hypothesis, H-one, if L of X surpasses Lambda. However, when L of X is exactly equal to Lambda, we decide on H-one with some probability, alpha, and on H-naught with a probability of one minus alpha. This probabilistic decision adds flexibility allowing for some level of uncertainty, which aids in controlling error probabilities.

Now, the optimal probability of a missed detection comes into play. This is the chance of overlooking the truth when H-one is actually correct. The formula here combines probabilities conditionally calculated when L of X is below or above our threshold, Lambda. It considers both the probability alpha and its complement, blending them to encapsulate the overall risk of missing true positives.

To ensure this decision rule is truly optimal, we apply a proof using a function called Delta star. Suppose Delta is any other decision rule that satisfies a given criterion for maintaining our desired false alarm probability, epsilon. By investigating the differences between Delta star and any alternative, we find that Delta star consistently yields a lower probability of missed detection, making it more effective.

For further clarity, let's use an example. Under the null hypothesis, suppose we're dealing with a standard normal distribution, while the alternate hypothesis assumes a different normal distribution with known mean and variance. Our likelihood function, L of X, transforms into an exponential function. Interestingly, testing on L of X simplifies to directly testing our observations, X, providing us an intuitive understanding of how decisions pivot based on observed data.

In essence, the slide underscores the elegance and efficiency of statistical decision-making. By defining a strategic threshold and integrating probability, we not only refine our hypothesis testing but remain adaptable, ensuring optimal outcomes amidst varying data conditions. This well-rounded approach equips us to make sound, data-driven choices in complex scenarios.
