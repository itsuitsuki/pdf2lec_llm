Building on what we've discussed about the likelihood ratio in binary hypothesis testing, let's dive deeper into how this concept plays out practically. Recall, we have two competing hypotheses: the null hypothesis, often denoted as H-naught, and the alternate hypothesis, H-one. The likelihood ratio helps us decide which hypothesis is more consistent with our observed data, X.

In simple terms, the likelihood ratio compares the probability of the observed data under the two hypotheses. It's computed as the probability or density of the data assuming the alternate hypothesis is true, divided by the probability or density of the data assuming the null hypothesis is true. This ratio gives a measure that can tip us towards one hypothesis or the other.

Now, let's explore how we make decisions using a Bayesian approach. In Bayesian hypothesis testing, we incorporate prior beliefs about the likelihood of each hypothesis being true. Consider π-zero and π-one as the prior probabilities for H-naught and H-one, respectively. These priors are our initial beliefs before observing any data.

The goal of Bayesian testing is to minimize the overall expected cost of making a decision. Each decision has associated costs—think of these as penalties for making incorrect decisions. The task is to select a decision rule that minimizes this expected cost by weighing the likelihood ratio against these costs and prior probabilities.

An effective decision rule helps us decide whether to accept the null hypothesis or switch to the alternate based on minimizing costs over many iterations. It combines our likelihood ratio with our priors and cost considerations, leading us to an optimal decision that aligns with both our initial beliefs and the new evidence.

This sophisticated blend of probability, cost, and prior belief forms the core of Bayesian inference in hypothesis testing. It's a powerful way to approach decision-making in uncertain situations, helping us make the most informed choices possible by leveraging both data and belief.
