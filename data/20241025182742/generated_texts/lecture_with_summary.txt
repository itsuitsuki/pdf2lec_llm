----- Slide 1 -----
Building on what we've discussed about the likelihood ratio in binary hypothesis testing, let's dive deeper into how this concept plays out practically. Recall, we have two competing hypotheses: the null hypothesis, often denoted as H-naught, and the alternate hypothesis, H-one. The likelihood ratio helps us decide which hypothesis is more consistent with our observed data, X.

In simple terms, the likelihood ratio compares the probability of the observed data under the two hypotheses. It's computed as the probability or density of the data assuming the alternate hypothesis is true, divided by the probability or density of the data assuming the null hypothesis is true. This ratio gives a measure that can tip us towards one hypothesis or the other.

Now, let's explore how we make decisions using a Bayesian approach. In Bayesian hypothesis testing, we incorporate prior beliefs about the likelihood of each hypothesis being true. Consider π-zero and π-one as the prior probabilities for H-naught and H-one, respectively. These priors are our initial beliefs before observing any data.

The goal of Bayesian testing is to minimize the overall expected cost of making a decision. Each decision has associated costs—think of these as penalties for making incorrect decisions. The task is to select a decision rule that minimizes this expected cost by weighing the likelihood ratio against these costs and prior probabilities.

An effective decision rule helps us decide whether to accept the null hypothesis or switch to the alternate based on minimizing costs over many iterations. It combines our likelihood ratio with our priors and cost considerations, leading us to an optimal decision that aligns with both our initial beliefs and the new evidence.

This sophisticated blend of probability, cost, and prior belief forms the core of Bayesian inference in hypothesis testing. It's a powerful way to approach decision-making in uncertain situations, helping us make the most informed choices possible by leveraging both data and belief.

----- Slide 2 -----
Building on our understanding of hypothesis testing, let's now focus on how decision-making is fine-tuned through cost considerations and probability constraints.

We start with the theorem dealing with costs. Imagine that our cost of making a certain type of error—say a false alarm, or incorrectly rejecting the true hypothesis—is zero in one scenario but positive when we make the reverse error. Here, if the cost of false alarm is zero, our decision rule simplifies to what's called a threshold rule. This means we only decide in favor of the alternate hypothesis when our likelihood ratio exceeds a specific threshold. This threshold is calculated based on our costs and prior probabilities.

Why does this matter? By setting appropriate thresholds, we ensure that our decisions are not just based on data or beliefs alone, but on a careful balance that minimizes the overall expected cost. Essentially, we're aiming for decisions that are the least costly or risky over time.

Now, let's switch gears to the Neyman-Pearson formulation, which introduces constraints on our error probabilities. This approach is important when we want to prescribe a maximum probability of making a false alarm. The false alarm is choosing H-one when H-naught is true. Importantly, we want to balance this with minimizing the probability of a missed detection—failing to choose H-one when it is, in fact, true.

The Neyman-Pearson theorem provides a randomized threshold rule. This rule allows us to define a likelihood ratio threshold while controlling the false alarm probability. Essentially, we can set the maximum error we're willing to accept, and the theorem guides us to the optimal decision rule that adheres to this constraint. It's like setting up guardrails so that our decision-making process doesn't swing too wildly to one side. A calibrated, systematic approach.

In practice, reducing false alarms is crucial. Imagine automated detection systems where too many false alarms could overwhelm the operators. Here, applying a structured decision rule not only keeps operations smooth but also maintains credibility and efficiency.

So, as you digest this information, remember that both the cost-based approach and the Neyman-Pearson framework provide powerful tools to enhance our decision-making processes. They ensure we're not just guessing in the dark but making choices that are informed, economical, and pragmatic, maintaining balance by respecting our constraints and optimizing the outcomes. This blend of theory and practice is the core of making sound, data-driven decisions.

----- Slide 3 -----
Let's focus on the optimal decision rule outlined in the context of hypothesis testing. We explored earlier how decisions are made based on the likelihood ratio. Here, we're diving into a more nuanced approach to decision rules that balance the trade-offs between false alarms and missed detections under certain constraints.

First, we have the optimal decision rule itself. We decide on the null hypothesis, H-naught, if our likelihood ratio, L of X, is less than a certain threshold, denoted by Lambda. Conversely, we lean towards the alternate hypothesis, H-one, if L of X surpasses Lambda. However, when L of X is exactly equal to Lambda, we decide on H-one with some probability, alpha, and on H-naught with a probability of one minus alpha. This probabilistic decision adds flexibility allowing for some level of uncertainty, which aids in controlling error probabilities.

Now, the optimal probability of a missed detection comes into play. This is the chance of overlooking the truth when H-one is actually correct. The formula here combines probabilities conditionally calculated when L of X is below or above our threshold, Lambda. It considers both the probability alpha and its complement, blending them to encapsulate the overall risk of missing true positives.

To ensure this decision rule is truly optimal, we apply a proof using a function called Delta star. Suppose Delta is any other decision rule that satisfies a given criterion for maintaining our desired false alarm probability, epsilon. By investigating the differences between Delta star and any alternative, we find that Delta star consistently yields a lower probability of missed detection, making it more effective.

For further clarity, let's use an example. Under the null hypothesis, suppose we're dealing with a standard normal distribution, while the alternate hypothesis assumes a different normal distribution with known mean and variance. Our likelihood function, L of X, transforms into an exponential function. Interestingly, testing on L of X simplifies to directly testing our observations, X, providing us an intuitive understanding of how decisions pivot based on observed data.

In essence, the slide underscores the elegance and efficiency of statistical decision-making. By defining a strategic threshold and integrating probability, we not only refine our hypothesis testing but remain adaptable, ensuring optimal outcomes amidst varying data conditions. This well-rounded approach equips us to make sound, data-driven choices in complex scenarios.

----- Slide 4 -----
In this slide, we're diving into the application of hypothesis testing in higher dimensions and exploring how threshold rules adapt to more complex data structures. 

First, consider the observation, denoted as X, which is an n-dimensional vector. Under our null hypothesis, this vector follows a normal distribution with a specific mean and covariance matrix. The mean is zero, and the covariance matrix is denoted as C. Under the alternate hypothesis, the vector still follows a normal distribution but with a different mean and the same covariance matrix, C.

An important concept here is the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix, C, which we can express as U times a diagonal matrix, D, times the transpose of U. This decomposition allows us to express our likelihood function, L of X, in a more tractable form. It's crucial because this helps us transform our multivariate normal problem into something more manageable by capturing the structure of the data using orthogonal and diagonal matrices.

Now, let's see how this links to our decision rules. The threshold test derived from this likelihood function simplifies our decision-making process. When determining whether to favor the alternate hypothesis, we compare the sum of the transformed variables against a threshold. This is essentially saying that the decision boils down to a simpler one-dimensional comparison, even though we originally had an n-dimensional setup.

Next, we move to a Poisson distribution setting. Under both hypotheses, X follows a Poisson distribution, but with different means under each hypothesis. What does our likelihood look like here? It's a ratio of the means of these distributions, raised to a power related to the number of observations, combined with an exponential component. This ratio dictates how we establish our thresholds.

Interestingly, the key takeaway remains consistent: regardless of the distribution—whether normal or Poisson—the decision ultimately hinges on comparing a transformed statistic against a threshold that reflects the underlying probability model. And, as we can see from the calculation involving the natural logarithm, our likelihood ratio threshold helps us decide which hypothesis to choose as the sample size, n, grows larger.

The beauty of this approach lies in its ability to take complex multivariate or distributional settings and simplify them into intuitive, one-dimensional tests. By considering both the covariance structure in the normal case and the rate parameters in the Poisson case, we're using our statistical tools to make principled and informed decisions. This capability is essential when handling real-world data that's inherently multidimensional or modeled by different distribution types.

Summary:

As we wrap up today’s discussion, we’ve journeyed through the crucial components of hypothesis testing, particularly focusing on decision-making under uncertainty. We began with the likelihood ratio, which serves as a powerful tool for comparing our observed data against two competing hypotheses—the null and the alternate. By integrating prior beliefs and associated costs, particularly in a Bayesian framework, we can tailor our decisions to be not just data-driven, but also mindful of potential penalties for errors.

We then explored ways to fine-tune our decision-making through cost considerations and the Neyman-Pearson approach, which allows us to set specific limits on error probabilities while seeking to minimize missed detections. The essence of this is establishing thresholds that guide our choices effectively.

In discussing higher dimensions, we showed how complex data can be simplified through techniques like the Cholesky decomposition, allowing us to make intuitive, one-dimensional decisions based on transformed statistics, whether dealing with normal or Poisson distributions.

Ultimately, mastering these concepts enables us to make informed, strategic decisions in real-world data analysis, ensuring we navigate uncertainty with confidence. Thank you for your engagement today!
