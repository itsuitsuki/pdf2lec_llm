Now, let's delve into the concept of posterior probability for Gaussian class-conditional densities. This might sound complex, but it's an important part of understanding how logistic regression works at a deeper level.

First, we assume that the variances are the same for different classes. This assumption helps simplify our calculations and makes it easier to understand the underlying mechanics. We start with one-dimensional feature vectors, but rest assured, the same principles apply when we extend to multiple dimensions.

The crux of this slide is to show how the posterior probability is linked to the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function. You've seen this function before as an S-shaped curve, crucial in mapping any input to a range between zero and one. It turns the linear combination of features into a probability.

Our task here is to understand that this probability is a logistic function of z, where z is a linear expression made up of our features. Specifically, z equals a weighted sum of the feature plus a bias term. Visually, the logistic function takes this z and squashes it into a probability.

Looking at the figure of the logistic function: it’s a strict, monotonically increasing curve. This means as z increases, the output of the logistic function moves from zero towards one, never dropping down. Such behavior ensures that we can reliably interpret the output as a probability.

Our next goal is to prove two essential things. First, that the logistic function only outputs values between zero and one — this is fundamental because the output represents probabilities. Second, we'll show that the expression one minus one over one plus the exponential function of negative z equals one over one plus the exponential function of positive z. This sound like a lot, but it's essentially showing symmetry in how probabilities are represented for class zero versus class one.

With these foundations, you’ll see how logistic regression elegantly handles classification into two classes. It combines simplicity with powerful probabilistic reasoning, useful in a myriad of applications. As you reflect on these points, consider how crucial this transformation is in interpreting the likelihood of different data classes, guiding us to make data-driven decisions accurately.
