Now, let’s bring all these ideas together by examining this proof step-by-step. We see on this slide how the log-odds, or logit, becomes a linear combination of our data.

We start by examining the equation that gives us the log of the ratio of probabilities—often referred to as the log-odds. This ratio provides a fascinating insight into our model by expressing the probability of being in Class 0 over Class 1, given our data.

First, notice that the term involving \( x \) minus the mean of each class is weighted by the inverse of the covariance matrix. This weighting helps determine how each feature contributes to class separability, depending on its variance and connection with other features.

But here comes the key transformation: this expression boils down to a linear relationship of inputs—what we refer to as the affine transformation. The changes in means (\( \mu_0 \) and \( \mu_1 \)) and the weighted sum \( \theta \), determine how the log-odds linearly relate to our data. That's represented by the \( \theta \) terms in conjunction with a bias term.

Importantly, there's this notion of bias, denoted as \( \theta_0 \), that adjusts our decision boundary without reliance solely on input weights. It’s a fine-tuning parameter that shifts our linear separator up or down as needed.

Then, as we switch gears to consider the probabilities, we delve into an elegantly simple expression—one over one plus the exponential of negative \( \theta \). This is our classic logistic function!

This transformation is crucial because it turns potentially unwieldy, complex relationships within our data into something universally interpretable—probabilities ranging from zero to one. It’s as if we’re providing clear probabilities for each classification decision we make. 

Remember, this entire affine transformation to logistic conversion isn’t just a neat mathematical trick. It’s a powerful means of interpreting and acting on multivariate data, putting at our fingertips not only prediction but clarity.

So, the next time you encounter a real-world dataset, visualize this process. Imagine your data passing through this affine transformation, through the logistic lens, to yield insights that guide decisions grounded in probabilities.

In this way, logistic regression becomes a critical ally in understanding the subtleties of the data-driven world we navigate.
