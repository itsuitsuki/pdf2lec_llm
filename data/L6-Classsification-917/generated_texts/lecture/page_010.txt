As we examine the graph of the logistic function, let’s explore why this S-shaped curve, or sigmoid function, is so pivotal in logistic regression.

The key element on this slide is the term "z," which is a linear combination of inputs. Here’s how we break it down: \( z \) consists of a linear function of \( x \), which is our input, multiplied by a weight, plus a bias term. This setup forms what we call an "affine function." But what does that mean? Essentially, it's a linear transformation that includes a shift—this shift is attributed to the bias term.

Now, how does this affine function relate to our Gaussian distributions? In this case, we assume our feature space is multivariate. So, instead of dealing with a simple line or curve, we’re working in a multi-dimensional space, denoted by \( x \) belonging to real numbers in d dimensions. This generalization allows us to tackle more complex, real-world data.

The slide asks us to prove that the posterior is, in fact, a logistic function of an affine transformation of \( x \). This aligns perfectly with our exploration of Gaussian class-conditional densities and Bayes' Rule. When we work with multivariate Gaussians, the probability of our data, given a class, follows a normal distribution characterized by a mean and covariance.

By expressing \( z \) as the sum of weighted features plus a bias, we are set to prove mathematically that our logistic function emerges directly from this affine transformation. In practical terms, it’s the process of transforming a possibly complex, high-dimensional input space into a manageable, interpretable probability measure.

What’s exciting here is the elegance of how logistic regression harnesses pure mathematical logic to decipher and classify data. The S-shaped logistic curve takes the guesswork out of binary classification, providing a robust and easily interpretable output.

As you explore logistic regression, remember this interplay of affine transformations and logistic functions. Each coefficient in our affine function—our weights and bias—carries meaningful insights about feature importance and class separability.

With these principles in mind, continue approaching binary classification challenges, using logistic regression as a tool not only for prediction but for understanding the intricate relationships within your data.
