Let's continue our exploration of logistic regression and its role in classification. This slide highlights the concept of using Gaussian class-conditional densities to derive the posterior probability, which is expressed through a logistic function.

First, let's break down the logistic function itself. This function is sometimes called the sigmoid function due to its characteristic 'S' shape. It's strictly increasing, meaning as the input value—often referred to as 'z'—increases, the function value also increases, transitioning smoothly between zero and one. This property is crucial because it allows us to interpret the output as a probability.

Now, how do we get to this function from Gaussian class-conditional densities? We assume that different classes have the same variance. By performing these calculations initially on one-dimensional feature vectors, we lay the groundwork for extending this to multiple dimensions.

Visualize 'z' as a linear combination of our features, which could be one's height or weight in a health dataset. Mathematically, 'z' is calculated by taking the sum of each feature value multiplied by a particular weight, plus a bias term.

In our specific context, we derive the posterior probability for a class by applying the logistic function to 'z'. The logistic function ensures the output is between zero and one, thus suitable for probability estimation.

To prove that the logistic function is strictly monotonically increasing, consider how its derivative is always positive, indicating that the function continuously ascends as 'z' increases. Additionally, we can show that the expression derived for the posterior probability—one divided by one plus the exponential of negative 'z'—matches our logistic function.

This approach allows us to use logistic regression as a powerful tool in binary classification by connecting statistical theory with practical computation. As we wrap up, remember these foundational concepts, as they open the door to more complex models and applications.
