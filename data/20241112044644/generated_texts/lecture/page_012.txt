Now, let's dive into this intriguing slide that offers a heuristic argument for using the logistic function in modeling probabilities. The core question here is: can we use affine functions to model posterior probabilities? Well, as the slide points out, direct application of affine, or linear, transformations would lead us astray. Why? Because a linear function can take any real value, from negative infinity to positive infinity. However, probabilities must reside within the closed interval between zero and one. So, an unbounded linear function isn't suitable for capturing probabilities directly.

Now, here's where the odds ratio comes into play. If we consider the odds of a particular event—represented by the probability \(p\) divided by one minus \(p\)—we find ourselves in a more flexible place: the boundaries extend from zero to infinity. This is better, but it still doesn't cover the whole real number line.

To fully harness affine transformations, we take a clever mathematical step: we apply a logarithm to the odds. This operation transforms our interval, allowing us to map the log of the odds onto the entire real number line, stretching from negative to positive infinity. Voila! We now have something we can model linearly.

This transformation gives birth to the logit function, which is the core of logistic regression. In this framework, the log of the odds is a linear function of the input features: the classic theta transpose x plus theta zero.

Why is this important? It allows us to harness the power of linear modeling to perform nonlinear classification. By transforming odds into log-odds, we smoothly convert linear predictions into probability estimates using the logistic sigmoid function.

In essence, this approach elegantly allows for modeling binary outcomes with linear parameters while respecting the probabilistic bounds necessary for real-world data analysis. So, as you continue to explore these principles, recognize this balance logistic regression strikes, forming a bridge between simplicity and flexibility in predictive modeling.
