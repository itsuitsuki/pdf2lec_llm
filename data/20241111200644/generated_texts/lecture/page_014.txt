Building on our previous discussion, let's delve into how we model the posterior probability distribution in logistic regression. 

Here, we introduce the concept of a Bernoulli random variable, which is crucial in the binary classification context. The binary class label \( Y \), which can take values of zero or one, follows this Bernoulli distribution. Now, associated with this is a probability parameter, denoted as mu, which represents the likelihood of \( Y \) equaling one, given the input data \( X \).

Let's break down the equation presented here. The probability of \( Y \) being one, given \( X \), equals one divided by one plus the exponential of the negative linear combination of input features and parameters. This expression elegantly emerges from the logistic function we discussed earlier. Essentially, it maps any linear input to a probability value between zero and oneâ€”exactly what we need!

In the binary case, the probability distribution is represented as \( mu of X \) to the power of \( Y \), times one minus \( mu \) of \( X \) to the power of one minus \( Y \). This formula accounts for two possible outcomes, ensuring the model can compute probabilities for both class zero and class one in a balanced manner.

As we prepare for our next session, we'll explore the technique of estimating our parameters, theta and theta-zero, through maximum likelihood. This approach will allow us to find the optimal parameter values that make our observed data most probable under the model. 

Understanding how probabilities are constructed and modeled in logistic regression is pivotal, as it forms the foundation for making accurate predictions. This technical groundwork empowers us to tackle challenging classification problems with confidence and precision.
