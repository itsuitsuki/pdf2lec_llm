On this slide, we're going to focus on the concept of posterior probability in the context of Gaussian class-conditional densities. This is an important concept that ties together statistical assumptions with logistic regression methods.

First, let's discuss Gaussian class-conditional densities. A Gaussian distribution, also known as a normal distribution, is a common way to model the distribution of continuous data. When we assume Gaussian class-conditional densities, we're asserting that the data for each class follows a normal distribution. Here, there's an important assumption: the variances are the same for the different classes. This simplification helps in deriving the logistic function for our posterior probabilities.

We start with one-dimensional feature vectors, which means we are dealing with a single variable to make our calculations straightforward. But remember, this approach easily extends to multiple dimensions—what we call d-dimensional cases—where multiple variables are considered simultaneously.

Next, let's link this to the logistic or sigmoid function. In this context, the logistic function maps the linear combination of input features to a value between zero and one. This transformation effectively models the probability of a data point belonging to a particular class, given the input features.

Mathematically, we're looking at a linear combination expressed as theta one times X plus theta zero, where theta represents weights and X the input features. This output, denoted as Z, is what we pass through the logistic function.

Now, let's delve into some properties. The logistic function is strictly monotonically increasing, meaning it consistently increases as its input increases. This function is also bounded between zero and one, capturing the essence of probabilities.

Finally, there's an intriguing aspect of the logistic function's symmetry: If you take one minus the logistic function, you essentially mirror it, which is an elegant feature ensuring robustness in classification tasks.

This slide encourages us to prove these properties, both theoretically and practically, cementing our understanding of logistic regression and its application to Gaussian class-conditional densities. This foundational knowledge will be very useful when designing classifiers that are both simple and efficient. Keep this connection in mind as we continue exploring advanced classification techniques!
