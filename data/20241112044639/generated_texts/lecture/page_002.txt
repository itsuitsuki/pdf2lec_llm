Continuing our exploration of the Neyman-Pearson framework, let's break down the optimal decision rule by examining the current slide.

Here, we encounter a pivotal concept — how to decide between \( H_0 \) and \( H_1 \) using the likelihood ratio \( L(x) \). The decision process involves a crucial threshold \( \Lambda \). If \( L(x) \) is less than \( \Lambda \), we accept the null hypothesis \( H_0 \). Conversely, if \( L(x) \) is greater than \( \Lambda \), we opt for the alternative hypothesis \( H_1 \). Now, there’s an interesting twist — when \( L(x) \) equals \( \Lambda \), we decide on \( H_1 \) with probability \( \alpha \) and on \( H_0 \) with probability \( 1-\alpha \).

This nuanced rule is crafted to minimize the probability of a missed detection, calculated as \( P_1(L(x) < \Lambda) + (1-\alpha)P_1(L(x) = \Lambda) \). This careful calibration helps manage the delicate trade-off between false alarms and missed detections.

The proof provided involves defining an alternative decision rule, \( \Delta \), and demonstrating through integration and expectation that our chosen rule, \( \Delta^* \), performs at least as well, ensuring the probability of a missed detection doesn’t increase.

Let's dive into the example to see this in action. Imagine under \( H_0 \), our variable \( X \) follows a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation sigma. Under \( H_1 \), it follows a normal distribution with a different mean, mu, but the same variance. This scenario often represents detecting a signal within Gaussian noise.

The likelihood ratio here becomes a function of \( x \), involving an exponent of terms that incorporate \( x \), the variance, and the mean difference. This expression guides our threshold test, enabling us to make informed decisions based on the observed value of \( x \).

This example encapsulates how decision-making frameworks translate theory into practice, illuminating the critical role of hypothesis testing in fields ranging from signal processing to statistics. Understanding this empowers us to tackle real-world problems with a robust statistical toolkit.
