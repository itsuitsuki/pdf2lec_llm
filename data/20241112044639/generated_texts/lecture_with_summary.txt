----- Slide 1 -----
Continuing from where we left off, let’s delve deeper into the exciting topic of binary hypothesis testing with a focus on the likelihood ratio and its implications.

Now, we’ve already touched on the notion of hypotheses. But let's remind ourselves of their significance: the null hypothesis, often denoted as \( H_0 \), represents our default assumption about the distribution of the random variable we're observing. On the other hand, the alternative hypothesis, \( H_1 \), offers a competing explanation.

The likelihood ratio plays a crucial role here. It’s essentially a tool that helps us compare these two hypotheses given a piece of data. Formally, it’s defined as the ratio of the probability density function of the alternate hypothesis to that of the null hypothesis. For a continuous random variable \( X \), this is expressed as the likelihood ratio \( L(x) = f(x \mid 1) / f(x \mid 0) \). 

What’s fascinating about the likelihood ratio is its ability to tell us how much more likely our observed data is under one hypothesis compared to the other. If \( L(x) \) is greater than one, our observed data favors the alternate hypothesis.

For discrete random variables, we define this in terms of probability distributions. Here, \( L(x) = p(x \mid 1) / p(x \mid 0) \), where \( p(x \mid 1) \) and \( p(x \mid 0) \) represent probabilities under \( H_1 \) and \( H_0 \), respectively.

Let’s not forget the Bayesian formulation, which adds another layer by incorporating prior beliefs, or what we call prior distributions. This approach assumes we have some prior knowledge or estimates about the likelihood of each hypothesis being true before we even see the data.

We calculate an overall expected cost based on decision rules to minimize errors in deciding which hypothesis to accept. This involves weighting costs of incorrect decisions by the probability of their occurrence, providing a structured way to manage uncertainty.

In our next segment, we’ll continue to explore how these theoretical concepts play out in real-world scenarios, illustrating the power and potential pitfalls of hypothesis testing. Keep these foundational ideas in mind, as they form the basis of much of the decision-making frameworks in statistical analysis.

----- Slide 2 -----
Continuing our journey into the captivating world of hypothesis testing, let's focus on decision-making costs and the Neyman-Pearson framework. 

We start by understanding decision rules in the context of costs. Imagine we're tasked with making decisions based on our hypotheses. Naturally, these decisions have consequences, often framed as costs. We denote \( c(0 \mid 0) \) as the cost of correctly accepting \( H_0 \) and similar notations apply for other scenarios. We aim for decision rules that minimize expected costs by balancing these probabilities and costs, especially when the cost of false alarms or missed detections differs.

The strategy involves a threshold rule for the likelihood ratio. When \( L(x) \) surpasses a certain threshold \( a \), we opt for the alternative hypothesis \( H_1 \). This threshold is calculated based on the cost ratio. The rule tells us to switch our decision at this threshold, minimizing the cost by setting \( \Delta(x) = 1 \) when necessary, which aligns with the statement in our theorem.

Next, we dive into the Neyman-Pearson framework. Its essence lies in setting a maximum acceptable probability for false alarms. A false alarm occurs when we incorrectly favor \( H_1 \) while \( H_0 \) is true. The aim here is not just to control false alarms, but to minimize missed detections — failing to detect \( H_1 \) when true.

The Neyman-Pearson lemma delivers a tool for finding optimal decision rules under such constraints. The theorem introduces a randomized threshold rule for the likelihood ratio. Here, instead of a strict cutoff, we choose a threshold \( \Lambda \) and an associated probability, ensuring that the probability of \( L(x) \) exceeding \( \Lambda \) is kept under a pre-set level \( \epsilon \).

This approach navigates the delicate balance between minimizing false alarms and missed detections, showing the math underneath decision-making frameworks. It's crucial for applications where consequences of errors differ drastically. By understanding these concepts, we're better prepared to devise strategies that factor in the realities of uncertainty and cost.

----- Slide 3 -----
Continuing our exploration of the Neyman-Pearson framework, let's break down the optimal decision rule by examining the current slide.

Here, we encounter a pivotal concept — how to decide between \( H_0 \) and \( H_1 \) using the likelihood ratio \( L(x) \). The decision process involves a crucial threshold \( \Lambda \). If \( L(x) \) is less than \( \Lambda \), we accept the null hypothesis \( H_0 \). Conversely, if \( L(x) \) is greater than \( \Lambda \), we opt for the alternative hypothesis \( H_1 \). Now, there’s an interesting twist — when \( L(x) \) equals \( \Lambda \), we decide on \( H_1 \) with probability \( \alpha \) and on \( H_0 \) with probability \( 1-\alpha \).

This nuanced rule is crafted to minimize the probability of a missed detection, calculated as \( P_1(L(x) < \Lambda) + (1-\alpha)P_1(L(x) = \Lambda) \). This careful calibration helps manage the delicate trade-off between false alarms and missed detections.

The proof provided involves defining an alternative decision rule, \( \Delta \), and demonstrating through integration and expectation that our chosen rule, \( \Delta^* \), performs at least as well, ensuring the probability of a missed detection doesn’t increase.

Let's dive into the example to see this in action. Imagine under \( H_0 \), our variable \( X \) follows a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation sigma. Under \( H_1 \), it follows a normal distribution with a different mean, mu, but the same variance. This scenario often represents detecting a signal within Gaussian noise.

The likelihood ratio here becomes a function of \( x \), involving an exponent of terms that incorporate \( x \), the variance, and the mean difference. This expression guides our threshold test, enabling us to make informed decisions based on the observed value of \( x \).

This example encapsulates how decision-making frameworks translate theory into practice, illuminating the critical role of hypothesis testing in fields ranging from signal processing to statistics. Understanding this empowers us to tackle real-world problems with a robust statistical toolkit.

----- Slide 4 -----
Let's delve into this intriguing slide, which introduces the complexities of hypothesis testing with multi-dimensional data and different distribution assumptions.

First, consider our observation, an n-dimensional vector X. Under the null hypothesis, X follows a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix C. Under the alternative hypothesis, it follows a different normal distribution with mean vector mu and the same covariance matrix C. The matrix C can be broken down into U, D matrices where U is orthogonal and D is diagonal with positive entries. 

The key statistic here is the likelihood ratio, denoted as L of X. It incorporates the inverse of the covariance matrix, C, emphasizing how changes in the vector X affect our decision-making. The expression might look daunting, but it essentially boils down to determining how much more likely our observation is under one hypothesis compared to the other.

Moreover, the slide suggests a clever technique: we can simplify the threshold test based on this complex likelihood ratio to another form involving a sum of transformed components of X, essentially leveraging linear transformations to make calculations more manageable.

We also explore a scenario where X follows a Poisson distribution — a common model for count-based data. Here, under the null hypothesis, the mean is mu zero, whereas under the alternative, it is mu one. The likelihood ratio then becomes a function of the observed count n, scaled by the ratio of the means. 

A remarkable insight from this slide is how a large enough sample size n can decisively favor one hypothesis over the other. If mu one exceeds mu zero, we tend to favor the alternative hypothesis as n grows larger and vice versa.

These concepts illustrate the seamless blend of mathematical theory and practical methodology in hypothesis testing. Understanding these principles enables us to navigate complex data landscapes, making informed decisions that reflect both statistical rigor and practical significance.

Summary:

As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on the essential themes we've explored in binary hypothesis testing. We started with the fundamental concepts of null and alternative hypotheses, emphasizing the significance of the likelihood ratio in comparing them. Remember, this ratio helps us understand how likely our observed data is under each hypothesis, guiding our decisions.

We then delved into the Neyman-Pearson framework, which introduces the idea of making decisions while considering the costs linked to false alarms and missed detections. This approach utilizes thresholds to help us navigate the trade-offs in our decisions effectively. As we discussed, this is especially crucial in real-world scenarios, such as signal detection.

Lastly, we examined multi-dimensional data and different distributions—from multivariate norms to Poisson distributions—showing how these concepts apply to varying contexts. Whether you're working with complex vector spaces or simple counts, these principles equip you with a robust toolkit for making informed decisions.
