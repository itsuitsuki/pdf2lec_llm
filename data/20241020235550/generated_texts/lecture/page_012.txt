Now, let's dive into this slide, which presents a heuristic argument for why we use the logistic function in modeling probabilities. 

First, let's recall why we love affine functions. They're those delightful linear transformations plus a constant shift. However, a linear function z, by its very nature, can take on any value from negative infinity to positive infinity. This doesn't work so well when we're dealing with probabilities, which are bound strictly between zero and one. So, using a linear model directly for probabilities? That's a no-go because it violates these basic probability rules.

But don't despair! There's a clever twist—let's introduce "odds." Odds are calculated as the probability of an event occurring divided by the probability of it not occurring. This gives us a value ranging from zero to positive infinity. For example, if the probability of rain is 0.2, the odds are 0.2 divided by 0.8, which is 0.25. 

To operate neatly within a linear framework, we turn to the log-odds, which is just the logarithm of these odds. By taking the log, we can map these odds into the entire real number line, from negative infinity to positive infinity. This transformation is magic because it allows us to employ linear models to predict something that initially seemed non-linear.

This is where the "logit" function steps in. The logit of a probability p is defined as the logarithm of the odds: log of p divided by one minus p. By expressing the logit of the probability as a linear function of the input features—theta transpose times x, plus a bias term theta zero—we elegantly bridge the gap between our input features and the probabilities we’re interested in.

So, to sum it up, we've taken something inherently non-linear—probability—and by cleverly using log-odds, transformed it into a problem that linear models can handle. This transformation is a cornerstone of logistic regression and beautifully demonstrates the significance of mathematical ingenuity in simplifying complex real-world problems.

As we move forward, remember this adaptation. It underscores the power of mathematical transformations in creating models that gracefully capture the probabilistic nature of real-world data. This is a perfect example of how we leverage theoretical insights to build practical tools in machine learning.
