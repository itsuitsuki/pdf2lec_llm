Now, let’s delve into the concept of posterior probability within the context of Gaussian class-conditional densities. This involves a few assumptions and some fascinating mathematics. 

First, you’ll notice we assume that different classes have the same variance. Why do this? By making this assumption, it simplifies our calculations and gives us a streamlined model to work with. We're initially dealing with one-dimensional feature vectors, but keep in mind, this approach scales to multiple dimensions just as effectively.

The heart of this calculation takes us back to the sigmoid function. You've seen this logistic curve before, characterized by its "S" shape. Here, it emerges naturally when calculating posterior probabilities.

Imagine z, which is the result of combining our input features linearly using weights and a bias term. This method mirrors our logistic regression setup. Specifically, z equals theta one times x plus theta zero, where theta represents our weights and x is our feature vector.

What’s intriguing here is that when we calculate the posterior probability using this setup, we find it transforms into the logistic function. This means the output—a probability between zero and one—is achieved by applying the logistic function to z. This insight allows us to effectively map input features to an interpretable probability of class membership.

To add another layer of understanding, the logistic function is strictly increasing. This means as the input z increases, so does the output from the logistic function, spanning a range from zero to one. It’s this property that guarantees we have a smooth transition between classes, reflecting a probabilistic perspective on class boundaries.

Moreover, the slide presents a mathematical curiosity: proving the logistic function’s expression. Simplifying expressions like one minus one over one plus the exponential of negative z gives us one over one plus the exponential of positive z. This reinforces the symmetry and beauty inherent in logistic functions.

As you tackle these ideas, remember: this method is more than number crunching. It’s about capturing relationships in your data and leveraging these mathematical transformations to predict and understand outcomes effectively. In essence, we’ve built a bridge from class-conditional Gaussian assumptions to posterior probabilities using logistic transformation—a powerful toolkit in machine learning.
