As we continue our journey through classification, let’s focus on a fundamental distinction we must make: the difference between classification and regression. While both are critical in machine learning, they serve different purposes.

In classification, unlike regression, the output isn’t a continuous value—it’s what we call a “label.” Think of labels as categories or distinct groups that our data might belong to. For instance, when we're dealing with binary classification, we often categorize data into one of two groups. A practical example could be classifying cholesterol levels as either “high” or “low.” Here, your output is simply zero or one—two distinct labels.

But wait, labels aren’t always binary. Some problems extend beyond two categories. Take, for example, the task of recognizing handwritten digits—a classic use case we see with datasets like MNIST. In this scenario, each digit from zero to nine represents a unique label. So, instead of just two categories, we have ten.

Now, considering the dataset we have, it’s described as pairs of inputs and outputs—our input data and its corresponding label. Think of the labels as the answers we are trying to predict. Using this dataset, our goal is to learn a function, a kind of rule, that can map new inputs to the correct label.

This process is not just mathematical curiosity; it’s practical engineering. By learning this mapping, our model can take new, unseen instances and classify them correctly—whether they be emails, images, or medical records.

Reflect on how this mapping works as you dive deeper into the assignments and experiments we have lined up. Remember, whether you're categorizing photos or text, the principles remain consistent. Your role is to explore how these labels can help machines make decisions that once required human judgment. By mastering this, you’re harnessing the power of machine learning to solve complex, real-world problems.
