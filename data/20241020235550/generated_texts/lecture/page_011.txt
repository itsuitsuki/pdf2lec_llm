Now, let's delve into this slide that beautifully demonstrates how we bridge the gap from linear discrimination to logistic regression through mathematical rigor. 

The starting point here is a deeper exploration of the relationship between class probabilities. We have the expression involving the natural logarithm — the log ratio of the probabilities for class zero versus class one, given feature x. This ratio is crucial because it represents the "log-odds," a term you'll often hear in statistics. Log-odds provide a way to express probabilities in an additive manner, which is highly valuable in logistic models.

Let's decode this expression a bit. The formula begins with a quadratic form, a standard way of encapsulating the difference between the two class means multiplied by the inverse covariance matrix. This initially intimidating expression actually simplifies into something elegant: a linear function, denoted here as theta transpose times x. This is our model’s backbone, which mirrors the same linearity we discussed with z in logistic regression.

The additional constants are aggregated into a bias term, theta zero, once again tying everything back to our logistic regression parameters. This shows how the properties of the Gaussian distribution contribute directly to our logistic function’s formulation.

Moving forward, the simplified form as shown – theta tilde transpose times x tilde – captures the essence of logistic regression. This transformation neatly combines both the bias and the feature interactions into a single encompassing function.

Now, notice the final expression here: the complete equation that leads us to the logistic function. The probability of class zero given x equals one divided by one plus the exponential of negative theta tilde transpose times x tilde. This is the logistic function itself, depicting how probability smoothly transitions, confirming that Logistic Regression harnesses an exponentially scaled transformation.

To sum up, this slide underscores a critical insight: under the assumption of equal variances for Gaussian class-conditional densities, the posterior probability indeed forms a logistic function. This validates our assumptions and models mathematically, reinforcing the natural yet powerful emergence of logistic regression in classifying binary outcomes.

In wrapping up, keep this proof as a reminder of the elegance behind logistic regression’s design—the seamless transition from linear discriminants to sophisticated, interpretable classification tools.
